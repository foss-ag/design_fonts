# design_fonts
A submodule of the [design_id](https://github.com/foss-ag/design_id) project. `design_fonts` stores the font files needed to create design assets in line with the corporate identity of the FOSS-AG.

### Clear Sans
Intel's [Clear Sans](https://01.org/clear-sans/) is the font used to render the typographic part of the main FOSS-AG logo and all its derivatives.

It is thus the branding font of the FOSS-AG; the first and *generic* choice when beginning a new FOSS-AG design project. Clear Sans can be used for anything from headers to body-copy. For now, it is also the *only* officially specified FOSS-AG font. In future, there will be style guidelines and recommendations with more fonts for specific purposes (like *body-copy*, or *code/typewriter*, etcetera).
